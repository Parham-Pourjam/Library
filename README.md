# Library

This program is a basic digital library, where users can mark any books they're planning to read or have finished reading. 

Users can change the read status (finished or currently reading) by clicking the top-left icon of the corresponding book card. Users can also remove any books from the library by clicking the "X" icon on the top right of the card. 

Go to https://parham-pourjam.github.io/Library/ to use the library program.
